# Toki

Developed through [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) 2D framework, Toki is a 2D puzzle video game based on [Two Tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Tribes_(company)) game named [Toki Tori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Tori).

Having bought the original game for the whole family, my daughter was afraid by the level monsters. So I decided to redo the game without monster.

> The game is developed through Ubuntu and has been tested on Windows 10.
